## About BlockBreaker

BlockBreaker is a 2D game created using game engine platform Unity and C# scripts.

Once the ball is launched by clicking the left key of the mouse, the player's goal is to destroy all breakable blocks without letting the ball drop. The player will control the horizontal position of the paddle by moving the mouse. The player will earn 98 points for each block they hit.

There are currently two levels in the game. After completing each level, the player will receive fireworks and an "Awesome!" cheers.
